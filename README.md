# MlOps with Open-Source Tools

This repository is to handle the code implemented for Edgardo Panza's thesis from the Master of Data Science.

It is divided into 2 folders that represent 2 chapters of the document.

##Â Chapter 9

In this folder you can find the code in jupyter notebooks that was used to create a machine learning model with the Cancer Breast dataset.

You can also find the dataset in its respective folder.

## Chapter 10

In this chapter several MLOps concepts were implemented to achieve the automation of the code and the monitoring of the results.

For automation I used "Airflow" which implements the concept of DAGS as well as scripts.

You can also find the code used in the filebeat file, which is in charge of monitoring the results and sending them to the ELK stack.
